# Helicopter-3D

Assignment 8 of *CS50 Introduction to Games Development* (by EDX/HarvardX) was to implement new features for a 3D remake of the classic 2004 Flash game *Helicopter Game*. This exercise served as an introduction to Unity/C#, getting us famaliar with programming game objects using components instead of the inheritance chains that we used in LÃ–VE 2D/Lua.

## Requirements
- Unity (v 2018.4) -> https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive or via Unity Hub https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

## Topics
- Introduction to Unity/C#
- Components
- Colliders & Triggers
- Prefabs & Spawning
- Texture Scrolling

## Assessment Criteria
- Add Gems to the game that spawn in the same way as coins. They should be both more rare and worth more points that coins.
- Fix a bug where the scroll speed of coins, planes, etc., doesn't reset when the game is restarted.
